                                    On purchase of Lectures via Google Link, Internet Connection will be required to download each and every lecture. Once lecture is downloaded, it can be viewed multiple times (Maximum 2 Times in case of Regular Lectures and
                                    Maximum 1.7 Times in case of Fast Track Lectures) just like a normal video without downloading again.

                                <p>On purchase of Lectures via Pen Drive, there is no need of Internet Connection as the lectures are sent in Pen Drive by us. (It is to be noted that Internet connection will be required to activate the key only once).</p>

                                    can format the pen drive and use as a storage media.
